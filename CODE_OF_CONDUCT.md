# Code of Conduct

## üéØ Our Standards

The BLS12-381 signature library is a **professional, enterprise-grade cryptographic project**. We maintain high standards for both **code quality** and **community interactions**.

### Professional Excellence Expected

This project demands **technical excellence**. We welcome contributors who:
- **Respect the codebase** and maintain its quality standards
- **Value precision** in both code and communication  
- **Understand cryptographic software** requires rigorous attention to detail
- **Appreciate thorough review processes** as necessary for security

### Communication Standards

**‚úÖ Encouraged Behavior:**
- **Precise, technical communication** with specific details
- **Constructive criticism** focused on code and technical merit
- **Patient collaboration** on complex cryptographic topics
- **Respect for maintainer decisions** on code quality standards
- **Professional discourse** even when disagreeing on technical approaches
- **Thorough preparation** before asking questions or submitting contributions

**‚ùå Unacceptable Behavior:**
- **Low-effort contributions** without proper research or testing
- **Arguing with established coding standards** or quality requirements
- **Disrespectful communication** toward maintainers or contributors
- **Harassment** of any kind (technical criticism is not harassment)
- **Spam or off-topic content** in issues or discussions
- **Ignoring review feedback** or arguing instead of addressing concerns

## üîß Technical Standards vs Personal Conduct

### Technical Standards (Non-Negotiable)
- **Code quality requirements** are **technical standards**, not personal preferences
- **Rejection of substandard code** is **professional necessity**, not personal attack
- **Demanding documentation** is **good software engineering**, not harassment
- **Insisting on comprehensive tests** is **responsible development**, not nitpicking

### Personal Conduct (Also Non-Negotiable)
- **Respectful communication** even when enforcing high standards
- **Professional tone** in all interactions
- **Constructive feedback** rather than personal criticism
- **Patient guidance** for contributors willing to meet standards

## üéì Learning Environment

### For New Contributors
- **Ask specific, well-researched questions** after reading documentation
- **Expect high standards** and use them as learning opportunities
- **Don't take code review personally** - it's about maintaining quality
- **Demonstrate effort** before asking for help

### For Experienced Contributors  
- **Help newcomers understand standards** rather than dismissing them
- **Share knowledge constructively** when reviewing contributions
- **Lead by example** in both code quality and communication
- **Mentor others** who show genuine effort to improve

## üö® Enforcement

### Quality Control Process
1. **Automated checks** catch basic standard violations
2. **Code review** ensures technical standards are met
3. **Community feedback** addresses communication issues
4. **Maintainer decisions** are final on technical matters

### Violation Response
- **First instance**: Educational feedback with specific guidance
- **Repeated issues**: Direct conversation about expectations
- **Persistent problems**: Temporary restriction from contributing
- **Severe violations**: Permanent ban from project

### What Triggers Enforcement
**Technical Issues (Educational Response):**
- Submitting code that doesn't meet standards
- Skipping required documentation or tests
- Not following established patterns

**Behavioral Issues (Progressive Response):**
- Disrespectful communication
- Arguing with maintainer decisions on technical standards
- Refusing to address legitimate review feedback
- Harassment or personal attacks

## üí° Success Framework

### How to Succeed Here
1. **Read everything first** - Documentation, contributing guide, existing code
2. **Start small** - Prove you can meet standards with minor contributions
3. **Ask good questions** - Specific, well-researched, with context
4. **Accept feedback gracefully** - View reviews as learning opportunities
5. **Contribute thoughtfully** - Quality over quantity, always

### Recognition System
Contributors who consistently demonstrate:
- **Technical excellence** in their contributions
- **Professional communication** in all interactions  
- **Mentorship** of other contributors
- **Deep understanding** of cryptographic principles

Will be recognized as **Trusted Contributors** with increased influence in project decisions.

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

### Standards Evolution
- **Technical standards** evolve with best practices and new Zig features
- **Process improvements** based on community feedback and project needs
- **Documentation updates** to clarify expectations and reduce friction

### Feedback Mechanism
- **Annual review** of contribution process and community health
- **Open discussion** of process improvements (with technical focus)
- **Maintainer retrospectives** on what's working and what needs improvement

## üìû Contact

### For Technical Standards Questions
- **GitHub Discussions**: Community-visible technical discussions
- **Issue Comments**: Specific questions about contribution requirements

### For Conduct Issues
- **Direct Message**: Reach out to project maintainers privately
- **Email**: conduct@zkevm.dev for serious conduct violations

### For Appeals
If you believe a decision was made in error:
1. **Wait 24 hours** before responding (emotions cloud judgment)
2. **Prepare technical justification** with specific examples
3. **Contact maintainers privately** with respectful, detailed explanation
4. **Accept final decisions** gracefully
