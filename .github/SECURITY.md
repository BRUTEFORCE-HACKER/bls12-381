## 🔧 Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Review Focus Areas
- **Input Validation**: Every external input must be validated
- **Memory Management**: All allocations must have clear ownership
- **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive data in error messages
- **Timing Attacks**: Be aware of variable-time operations
- **Side Channels**: Consider cache timing and power analysis

### Secure Development Guidelines
```zig
// ✅ Good: Input validation
pub fn processSignature(sig_bytes: []const u8) !Signature {
    if (sig_bytes.len != SIGNATURE_SIZE) {
        return error.InvalidSignatureLength;
    }
    // ... continue with validated input
}

// ❌ Bad: No validation
pub fn processSignature(sig_bytes: []const u8) !Signature {
    // Assumes input is correct - SECURITY VULNERABILITY
}

// ✅ Good: Secure memory clearing
pub fn sensitiveOperation(secret: []u8) !void {
    defer std.crypto.utils.secureZero(u8, secret);
    // ... use secret
}

// ❌ Bad: Secrets left in memory
pub fn sensitiveOperation(secret: []u8) !void {
    // ... use secret
    // Secret remains in memory - SECURITY ISSUE
}
```

## 📊 Security Testing

### Required Security Tests
- **Fuzzing**: All input parsing functions
- **Memory Safety**: Valgrind/AddressSanitizer clean
- **Timing Analysis**: No variable-time crypto operations
- **Side Channel**: Power analysis resistant (where applicable)

### Continuous Security
- All dependencies scanned for known vulnerabilities
- Regular cryptographic security reviews
- Automated memory safety testing in CI/CD
- Performance regression detection (timing attack prevention)

## 🔐 Cryptographic Guarantees

### What We Promise
- **Signature Security**: 128-bit security level
- **Memory Safety**: No buffer overruns or memory corruption
- **Implementation Correctness**: Full compliance with BLS standards
- **Side-Channel Resistance**: Constant-time where cryptographically required

### What We Don't Promise
- **Quantum Resistance**: BLS12-381 is not post-quantum secure
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Not applicable to signature schemes
- **Anonymous Signatures**: BLS signatures are not zero-knowledge proofs
